# Encryption-Decryption

Imagine if a third person gets some of our private information say our credit card number. So, we use encryption to send data over the internet.

That means To protect data on our Android device we use Encryption and Decryption

In simple terms, encryption is the process of converting plain text or data into a code or cipher so that it becomes unreadable to unauthorized users.
Decryption is the reverse process of encryption, where the encrypted data is converted back into its original form.

In this Repository we have provided examples of how to implement Encryption and Decryption using both Symmetric Key Encryption - AES, and Asymmetric Key Encryption - RSA
